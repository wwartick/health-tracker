# What is this?

This is a project to showcase and hone my skills in React and JS. I want an app that I can check at the start of the day, and record my thoughts with at the end of the day. My initial goals are to have it display the time, date, weather, and sports schedule for teams that I follow. I also want it to have a water counter that tracks the amount of oz of water I drink a day(manual input using an interface on the app) as well as a blog-like function to track my job search. I want three sections to be on the nav bar with a persistent header/footer. The three sections I want to have are "job's applied to", "leet code daily challenges", and "daily recap". 

# Goals

A project I can come back to every day and work on and make better. Ideally I can comeback and update this site with better features and design as I expand my knowledge in JS and React, although I also plan to create at least 1 other app to spruce up my portfolio. The end goal here is to get a full time job as a web developer. Below I will leave a daily changelog. Hopefully I maintain steady progress so that there is an impressive list below, but I also hope that I can easily create and clean up this site to show how fast I can work. Essentially this is my coding diary to track my journey into tech.
